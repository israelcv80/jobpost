      "The Challenge:</b> Enabling advanced data-intensive science at scale on energy-efficient supercomputers. In 2020, NERSC will begin deploying its first production heterogeneous CPU/GPU-based Cray supercomputer, “Perlmutter.” Perlmutter, a system optimized for science, includes future-generation AMD CPUs, next-generation NVIDIA GPUs, a high-speed interconnect, and an all-flash file system. Many codes running at NERSC must be adapted or optimized to run efficiently on GPUs, and solutions that put GPU performance in the hands of users must be portable ones. NESAP is about employing cutting-edge computational science techniques and advanced performance analysis tools to develop highly scalable, distributed parallel algorithms to meet this challenge.</p><p><b>\n",
      "NESAP for Data (N4D):</b> This posting is focused on the data-intensive science workload on Perlmutter. To answer today’s most complex experimental challenges, scientists are collecting exponentially more data and analyzing it with new computationally intensive algorithms. N4D addresses data-intensive science pipelines that process massive datasets from experimental and observational science (EOS) facilities like synchrotron light sources, telescopes, microscopes, particle accelerators, or genome sequencers. The goal is seamless integration and data flow between EOS facilities and supercomputing resources to enable scalable real-time data analytics: A “Superfacility.”</p><p>\n",
      "As a N4D Fellow, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of computational and domain scientists working together to transition and optimize codes to the Perlmutter system and produce mission-relevant science that pushes the limits of HPC.

      "</div></div><div>Facebook is seeking Research Interns to join our Natural Language Processing teams in Menlo Park, California, Redmond, Washington, and Seattle, Washington. These teams are part of the Facebook AI Applied Research and Messenger Assistant organizations within Facebook, working to advance the state of the art in natural language understanding and generation, and deploys these systems at scale to break down language barriers, enable people to understand and communicate with anyone, and to provide a safe experience—no matter what language they speak. The opportunities and challenges of this work are immense. Billions of people use our services to connect and communicate in their preferred language, but many of these languages lack traditional NLP resources and our systems need to be robust to the informal tone, slang and typos often found in daily communication. Our research spans multiple areas across NLP and machine learning, including deep learning/neural networks, machine translation, natural language understanding and generation, low-resource NLP, question answering, dialogue, and cross-lingual and cross-domain transfer learning. As a Research Intern, you will help us apply cutting-edge NLP algorithms to a wide range of media understanding challenges at Facebook.

      "Founded in 2017 by a team of experienced digital health and technology executives, OODA Health is transforming the administration of healthcare. Today, the US healthcare system wastes $400 billion every year on an outdated and broken claims adjudication process that creates friction and frustration for payers, providers and patients alike. Patients wrestle with surprise bills that arrive months after care is received and are impossible to understand. Providers suffer unexpected denials and delays for reimbursement, and chase patients for payment rather than focus on delivering care. Payers are locked in zero sum negotiations with providers, unable to advance care management goals.</div><div>\n",
      "</div><div>\n",
      "OODA Health is transforming the administrative experience in healthcare by enabling collaborative, real-time interactions between providers, members and payers. With the OODA Health solution, claims adjudication will be instantaneous, and providers will be paid upon patient checkout. Payers will assume responsibility for patient collections, guaranteeing immediate payment to the provider and relieving physicians from chasing patients for money. Care management strategies will be based on real-time patient risk models, rather than retrospective claim reviews. Critical interactions will occur at the point of care, rather than months after an encounter.</div><div>\n",

If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.<br/>\n",
